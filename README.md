This project implements a lightweight Text Summarization Tool that automatically extracts the most relevant sentences from a given text. It works by calculating word frequencies (excluding stop words) and scoring sentences based on the significance of their words. The top-scoring sentences are selected to generate a concise summary.

The tool includes both a demo mode using sample articles and an interactive mode where users can input their own text for summarization. It uses basic NLP techniques and does not require external machine learning libraries, making it fast and easy to run on any system.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python 3: Core programming language used.

Built-in Python Libraries:

re — for text preprocessing using regular expressions.

collections.Counter — to count word frequencies.

heapq.nlargest — to select top-ranked sentences based on scoring.

Terminal/Command Line: For user interaction in interactive mode.
